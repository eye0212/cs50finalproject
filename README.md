Taking the Musician Quiz

Immediately after making a new account, the web app will direct you to a mandatory page with a ten question quiz to fill out. This quiz is how the web app learns about your musical preferences and will internally assign you a score. 

Musicians Page

After taking the musician quiz, the web app will direct you to the musicians page where you can see the information of every other user. Here, you have access to their name, age, location, email, compatability score, and a head shot. The compatability score is a number from 0-100 that represents how compatible the current user is to another user based on the results from the musician quiz.
