**Subito** is a web app implemented using Flask, jinja, and bootstrap that matches users based on their classical music preferences - designed to bring musicians together online. Our website includes a quiz designed to characterize usersâ€™ preferences as a function of 4 key variables, and then provides them with scores ranking the compatibility of their tastes with respect to other users.

The compatability score is a number from 0-100 that represents how compatible the current user is to another user based on the results from the musician quiz.
